The MoinMoin wiki is good stuff, and I'm using it to work on my
thesis.  While working, however, I need to produce references to
entries in my bibtex database.  What follows are macros that allow
just this.

It adds two additional tags:

<<Ref(bibtex-key)>>
	This introduces a citation (and adds a footnote to the page)

<<RefText(bibtex-key)>>
	This produces the text of a citation.  It's not really
	designed for general use.  Instead, it is called by Ref()
	as necessary.  But, if, for some reason, you'd like to
	have the full text of a citation, there you go!

INSTALLATION:
	- you must install bib2xml
		http://www-plan.cs.colorado.edu/henkel/stuff/bib2xml/
	- you must copy Ref.py and RefText.py to
		$(prefix)/python-$(pyver)/site-packages/MoinMoin/macro
	  (essentially this means putting it in the same directory
	   as "FootNote.py" which is distributed with MoinMoin)
	- restart moinmoin

TODO:
- cache copy of XML database (or parse natively)
	- currently, bib2xml is called everytime a reference text
	  is needed.  This is inefficient.  Perhaps we can cache
	  the conversion results and save off a pickle.  Also,
	  we could store the current bibdb in the request, so at
	  least it's only done once per page?
- remove dependency on bib2xml
	pyliographer has a python-bibtex module, which parses
	 a bibtex file.  The API is simply awful. however, a wrapper
	 could be used around it.

- many document types are missing for formatting:
	booklet conference inbook incollection manual mastersthesis
	misc phdthesis proceedings techreport unpublished

FUTURE:
	- Provide a style mechanism.  Perhaps bibtex .bst could be
	leveraged?
