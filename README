The MoinMoin wiki is good stuff, and I'm using it to work on my
thesis.  While working, however, I need to produce references to
entries in my bibtex database.  What follows are macros that allow
just this.

It adds two additional tags:

<<Ref(bibtex-key)>>
	This introduces a citation (and adds a footnote to the page)

<<RefText(bibtex-key)>>
	This produces the text of a citation.  It's not really
	designed for general use.  Instead, it is called by Ref()
	as necessary.  But, if, for some reason, you'd like to
	have the full text of a citation, there you go!

TODO:
- automatically generate the XML bibtex db
	- Currently, one must modify RefText.py to include a reference
		to your xml-ified bibtex database.
	- This database can be produced using bib2xml
		http://www-plan.cs.colorado.edu/henkel/stuff/bib2xml/
	  Currently it must be done manually.
	FIX: pyliographer has a python-bibtex module, which parses
	 a bibtex file.  The API is simply awful. however, a wrapper
	 could be used around it.
		http://pybliographer.org/
	ALTERNATIVE: require the user to install bib2xml and call it
		as necessary.  It should be possible to cache the
		results and save off a python pickle for quick references.
	(It might also be possible to combine the two approaches)
- many document types are missing for formatting:
	booklet conference inbook incollection manual mastersthesis
	misc phdthesis proceedings techreport unpublished

FUTURE:
	- Provide a style mechanism.  Perhaps bibtex .bst could be
	leveraged?
